    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Providing quality feedback is essential but it also takes enormous amounts of time. It is likely to be more efficient and useful if instead of rewriting similar comments for individuals, you create a document that identifies patterns of learner behaviour across the whole cohort and attach it to the comments section in the rubric. Another large benefit of this approach is that it helps identify if the rubric is fit for purpose and if some or all of the criteria are providing enough guidance for the learners. Whole-class feedback also helps you evaluate if the assessment is doing what you intend it to do or if it needs to be adjusted.</p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>All summative assessment requires feedback, and it is most useful when it can be used by learners to help shape their ability to achieve in the next task. Some learners may still need individual comments, but many, if directed sufficiently, will be able to cross-check their awarded grade for each criterion in the rubric with the whole-class feedback and understand why they were awarded the grade they did.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>When marking, you will likely see patterns emerge of how students are responding to the criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin to write down these observations and categorise them so they align with the rubric criteria.</li>
<li>Assign grades in the rubric as you would, but instead of commenting on each criterion or at the end, add a link to the whole-class feedback document.</li>
<li>Instruct learners before the assessment that this will be the process and model for them how they should use the whole-class feedback to self-evaluate their grades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Worked Example</h3>
<p>Below is an example of how a rubric was used in conjunction with whole-class feedback for an assignment.</p>
<p>How Learning Works and Sources of Learning Criterion:</p>
<p><img src="." alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Students who didn’t discuss particular aspects of the learning process that were emphasised repeatedly throughout the course did not do as well as those who did in that section.</li>
<li>Not many students connected the final section about the future with the learning section. Those who did, received a stronger grade. This is because the assignment is about learning and in order to put plans into action, ‘how learning happens’ needs to be a consideration. For example, the idea of repetition (interrupting the forgetting curve) would be useful to turn action into a habit, a usual necessity when changing behaviour patterns.</li>
<li>Students who only discussed when learning occurs rather than how it occurs did not receive the strongest grades in that section</li>
<li>Those who didn’t discuss Ashley in the learning section were not able to receive an HD grade in that section</li>
<li>The 70/20/10 is a model that applies to those in the workforce, and many students misinterpreted it in relation to a full-time student. A full-time student flips the numbers, with formal learning equating to 70%. Ashley would not be expected to have the majority of her learning from her part-time work and volunteering. Whilst most didn’t suggest this, those who mentioned the model didn’t sufficiently critique it for Ashely’s context. What could have been explored is Ashely trying harder to find work that is more related to her study so she could make more connections between the study and the work, or that the 70% is more about action and application of knowledge, which is what some assessments could cover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who constructed a strong opening and introduction and followed what they said they would discuss throughout the report succeeded more than those who didn’t.</li>
<li>If a section was too short it didn’t get a strong grade</li>
<li>In terms of referencing. You didn’t get full marks if
<ul>
<li>References weren’t in alphabetical order</li>
<li>There were 5 or less references – not enough evidence to suggest a pattern</li>
<li>You didn’t follow the Harvard model</li>
<li>Dates were not following the model</li>
<li>In-text citation was incorrect</li>
<li>Some referencing was correct but not all</li>
<li>Italics used inconsistently</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
