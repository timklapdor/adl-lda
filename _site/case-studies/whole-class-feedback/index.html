<p>Having marked many hundreds of papers before, I was conscious of wanting to make the most of my time and reduce duplication of comments and also to help me record observations of how learners were going in the assessment overall to help refine future iterations of it. As soon as I began marking, I noted down observations of how learners were addressing criteria. Patterns of responses became quite clear in specific criteria and this let me feel more confident that I could refrain from adding a similar comment to each learner’s rubric and direct all learners to the whole class feedback regarding specific sections of the marking scheme.</p>
<p>I still added comments in some cases for responses that were unique or if a specific strategy was needed for the learner to improve, but overall I am quite sure that I saved at least an hour’s worth of marking time by creating whole-class feedback for a relatively small marking cohort. I could obviously use the same feedback if I was charged with a larger number of learners, so this approach is certainly scalable.</p>
